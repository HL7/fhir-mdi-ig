Welcome to the HL7 Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) FHIR Implementation Guide

This US-specific implementation guide (IG) provides guidance on the exchange of information to and from medicolegal death investigation (MDI) information systems. It supports interoperability between the MDI case management systems (CMS) of medical examiner and coroner (ME/C) offices, forensic toxicology and other laboratory information management systems (LIMS), electronic death reporting systems (EDRS) of jurisdictional vital records offices, and ancillary workflows whose systems have the capability of utilizing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). 

This branch is the active branch for applying changes to the Continuous Integration (CI) Build for the MDI FHIR IG (https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/).

The latest published version of the published IG is available at http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mdi/

The MDI project also supports the Violent Death and Overdose Reporting (VDOR) FHIR IG, which is a working draft of common violent death and overdose data elements that may be incorporated into the MDI IG at a later date. The starting point for the FHIR resources in the VDOR IG is the definitions of the data reported to the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS).
