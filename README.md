Welcome to the HL7 Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) FHIR Implementation Guide

This US-specific implementation guide (IG) provides guidance on the exchange of information to and from medicolegal death investigation (MDI) information systems. It supports interoperability between the MDI systems of medical examiner and coroner (ME/C) offices, forensic toxicology and other laboratory information management systems (LIMS), electronic death reporting systems (EDRS) of jurisdictional vital records offices, and ancillary workflows whose systems have the capability of utilizing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). 

This branch is the active branch for applying changes to the Continuous Integration (CI) Build for the MDI FHIR IG (https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/).
