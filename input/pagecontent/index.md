### Overview

This US-specific IG provides guidance to implementers and jurisdictions on the exchange of information to and from a case management systems. It supports interoperability between the case management systems of medical examiner and coroner departments, hospital electronic health record (EHR) systems, toxicology and other laboratory information systems (LIS), jurisdictional vital records offices, and public health departments. Data workflows include the receipt of toxicology information into a case management system and sending information to a jurisdictional health department. Additionally, it supports medical examiners/coroners (ME/C) in viewing information from a decedentâ€™s EHR for death investigations. The design intent of this IG is to create a base that states can further specify for exchange state-specific data.
