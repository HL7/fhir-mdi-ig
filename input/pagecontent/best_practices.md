The MDI FHIR IG is designed to be light-weight and flexible, recognizing that information management systems used for assembling medicolegal death investigation data vary widely by state, jurisdiction, and agency. This means that many data concepts have few requirements but many “must support” designations. This section provides best practice recommendations on how to address select concepts.

# Decedent
This MDI FHIR IG uses the US Core Patient for the decedent subject of:
* Specimen - Toxicology Lab
* Toxicology Lab Observation Result
* DiagnosticReport - Toxicology Lab Result to MDI
* Composition - MDI to EDRS

The [US Core Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html) profile requires 
* 1..* patient identifier, each identifier specifying a system and value
* 1..* patient name
* 1..1 gender code (AdministrativeGender). Note modeling gender and sex information is ongoing in HL7. Refer to [US Core Patient profile, “Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements.”](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html#mandatory-and-must-support-data-elements)
The three data elements may not be known during early stages of medicolegal data collection. US Core provide guidance on such cases of [missing data]( http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#missing-data).

# Identifiers and Tracking Numbers
This MDI FHIR IG provides opportunities for both identifiers and tracking numbers. 
* **Identifiers**: Identifiers are unique to a particular instance of the FHIR resource being transmitted and are often automatically generated by a system. 
* **Tracking numbers**: Tracking numbers in this MDI IG represent case or record numbers, usually assigned by the originating organization such as an ME/C office or an EDRS and usually persist throughout updates to the death investigation data. They are optional and multiple tracking numbers may be recorded. The extensible ValueSet - Tracking Number Type contains codes to identify the type of tracking number and may be augmented by local implementations of this IG. 

# Certification
Agencies and jurisdictions have a range of requirements for certification of information during the process of collecting and exchanging MDI data. Typically, a forensic toxicology diagnostic report will be considered certified when the final version is sent. Likewise, a document bundle sent from an MDI system to an EDRS can use the status data element to indicate preliminary or final and certified.

This MDI FHIR IG provides opportunities on most profiles for naming the responsible party. The legal nature of certification is a business requirement to be assigned by each agency or jurisdiction implementing this IG.

# Forensic Toxicology Laboratory Specimens & Results

**One-to-many specimen to results relationship:** Each specimen, represented by a Specimen - Toxicology Lab resource, must be referenced by at least one Observation - Toxicology Lab Result and may be referenced by more than one Observation - Toxicology Lab Result. For example, a single blood specimen may be analyzed for several different analytes or by several different methods. Each of those specimen/analyte or specimen/method combinations will be represented by an Observation - Toxicology Lab Result.

**Specimens received but not analyzed:** ME/Cs may need to know if a forensic toxicology laboratory received a specimen but did not analyze it. In such cases, the laboratory should provide a reason for no analysis in the DiagnosticReport.conclusion and/or each unanalyzed specimen's Specimen - Toxicology Lab Specimen.note. Additionally, the Specimen - Toxicology Lab may use the Specimen.condition to describe the state of the specimen via codes from the extensible value set [hl7VS-specimenCondition](https://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet-v2-0493.html) and/or use the Specimen.note to describe details or issues about the specimen.

**Reporting results:** The result of a specimen analysis is required to be reported as text and may also be represented by a code. This allows exchange of the result meaning among systems that do not share code systems or do not use standardized code systems. The value of the result may be reported in several text formats:
* Word or phrase indication presence or absences with no quality (e.g., “Detected”, “Not detected”)
* Mathematical expression of quantity with units (e.g., “= 0.160 g/dL”)
* Mathematical expression of quantity range with units (e.g., “< 2.5 ng/mL”)

# Death Date
The Observation – Death Date profile represents the actual or presumed date of death. It provides several opportunities to explain the date listed as Death Date:

**Specific date or range of dates:** If the actual date of death is known (date, date-time, or partial date such as year or year + month), set value resource type to dateTime. If the date of death is not known, and a range is known, set value resource type to Period, defined by a start and end dateTime.

**Unknown date:** Use the dataAbsentReason resource for missing all or part of the decedent's death date (further information can be recorded in the note data element).

**Qualifying the accuracy of the date of death:**
* Use the status resource for qualifiers contained in the value set observation-status (registered, preliminary, final, etc.). This value set contains 8 concepts and is not extensible (cannot be added to by local implementations).
* Use the interpretation resource codes from the extensible Value Set - Date Death Qualifiers (exact, approximate, etc.)

# API Specifications
The MDI FHIR IG is designed for RESTful API implementations supporting data exchange interactions between systems via standard operations. (For an overview, see [Restful API](https://hl7.org/FHIR/http.html0.) This IG uses a subset of the many [RESTful API operations](https://hl7.org/FHIR/operationslist.html#1.5) defined by FHIR. All API implementations of this MDI FHIR IG must conform to common design rules:
* MIME-type for FHIR resources is application/fhir+xml or application/fhir+json. This must be specified for Content-Type in the HTTP header.
* application/x-www-form-urlencoded can be used for POST search requests if HTTP Form is used.
