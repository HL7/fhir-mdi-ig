# Example Scenario: Oxycodone & Alprazolam Overdose
The scenario illustrated in the IG example files is of Jasmine M. Rogers, a 55-year-old woman admitted to Manâ€™s Greatest Hospital with lethargy and fever on 1/1/22 from a skilled nursing home where she was a resident for 12 years. She was diagnosed with *Staphylococcal sepsis* arising from large decubitus ulcers of her back and buttocks. Despite treatment with intravenous antibiotics, she developed worsening hypotension and septic shock and died on the 3rd hospital day.

The decedent had a remote history of drug abuse. When she was 43 years old, she became a resident of the skilled nursing facility after she survived an overdose of alprazolam and oxycodone but was left with anoxic brain damage and was unable to care for herself. She periodically developed pressure ulcers from mostly being confined to bed. Over the 4 months before her death, she developed new pressure ulcers that were unresponsive to treatment because of her poor nutritional status.
