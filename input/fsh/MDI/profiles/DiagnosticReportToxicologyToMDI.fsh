Title: "DiagnosticReport - Toxicology Lab Result to MDI"

Description: """This profile contains constraints to the US Core Diagnostic Report Profile to address the use case for sending data from a forensic toxicology laboratory information management system to an MDI information management system.
Each analyzed specimen, represented by a Specimen - Toxicology Lab resource, must be referenced by at least one Observation - Toxicology Lab Result and may be referenced by more than one Observation - Toxicology Lab Result.
For specimens received but not analyzed, the laboratory should provide a reason for no analysis in the DiagnosticReport.conclusion and/or each unanalyzed specimenâ€™s Specimen - Toxicology Lab Specimen.note."""
