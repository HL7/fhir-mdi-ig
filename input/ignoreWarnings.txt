# 10 - Other slicing issues in examples, some related to US Core 5.0.1, which defines slices for several profiles that this IG references, based on the value of pattern:$this. The discriminator type 'pattern' has been deprecated, which affects profiles in this IG. See: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/deprecated.20pattern.20slicing

% The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
