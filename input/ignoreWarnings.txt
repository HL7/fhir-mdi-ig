INFORMATION: CodeSystem/CodeSystem-vr-codes: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Bundle examples have optional slices that are not defined in the profile; not matching is expected behavior. All slices have been reviewed and verified.
